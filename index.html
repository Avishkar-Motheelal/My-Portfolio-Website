            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I am a tech savvy individual that is always looking to learn and
               understand more about the tech industry. It fascinates me how
               technology is changing the world and helping to solve issues, and I
               would like to be part of making these changes.
               I am a fast learner and work well within a team as well as
               individually. I have a huge passion for software development,
               learning new concepts and problem solving.

            <h3>Al-Buraq Fast Foods</h3>
            <h3>Co-Owner and manager</h3>
            <h4>February 2020 - June 2021 (1 year 5 months)</h4>
            <p>My roles were daily stock take, purchasing, accounting, managing 2
               employees and serving customers.
               The business was sold in June 2021 in order for me to have the time to
               continue my studies

            <h3>Elite Vapery</h3>
            <h3>Owner</h3>
            <h4>November 2017 - January 2020 (2 years 3 months)</h4>
            <p>I founded Elite Vapery in late 2017 as a passion project to pursue my interest
               in entrepreneurship as well as helping people to stop smoking cigarettes and
               move to a less damaging alternative option. I developed and ran the website
               and business as a whole on my own until early 2020 when it was closed in
               order for me to give my full time and attention to the new business opportunity
               that presented itself.
