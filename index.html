            <p class="card-content">I am a tech-savvy individual that is always looking to learn and
                understand more about the tech industry. It fascinates me how
                technology is changing the world and helping to solve issues, and I
                would like to be part of making these changes.
                I am a fast learner and work well within a team as well as
                individually. I have a huge passion for software development,
                learning new concepts and problem-solving.

                    <p class="card-content">I founded Elite Vapery in late 2017 as a passion project to pursue my
                        interest
                        in entrepreneurship as well as helping people to stop smoking cigarettes and
                        move to a less damaging alternative option. I developed and ran the website
                        and business as a whole on my own until early 2020 when it was closed in
                        order for me to give my full time and attention to the new business opportunity
                        that presented itself.
